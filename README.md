# OpenGL-PBR
### **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

A personal project through which I want to learn Physical Based Rendering.  
The project is written using OpenGL and GLSL. It's based on my [OpenGL Template](https://github.com/lumixem/OpenGL_Template).

This project was supposed to be game created using OpenGL at first but I decided to learn PBR Rendering first. Maybe I will create a simple game in the future using
this renderer to show its features.

### Libraries/Tools used:
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
